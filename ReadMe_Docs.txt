#---------- 14 Nov 2018
This repository uses the MkDocs (v0.17.2) utilities for documentation rendering.
From the repo root directory, "mkdocs --help" shows the options.
"mkdocs build" for example, writes a set of html documents under the ./site subdirectory

(Aside: ./site is NOT currently in the .gitignore file; insertion pending for consistency).
